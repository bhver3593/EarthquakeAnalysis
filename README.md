# EarthquakeEducation

EarthquakeEducation is a Python application that provides information on earthquakes by generating random Richter Scale values
and using these values to determine the amount of energy produced, their shaking level, and their impact on the environment.


## What I learned
- Modular programming
- Utilizing a random number generator to generate numbers within a specified range
- Reading and writing to text files
- Processing lists
- Exception handling

## How It Works
- After running the earthquakeAnalysis.py file, 20 random Richter values are generated and written to a text file
- The Richter values are read from the text file and used to calculate the amount of energy produced, the earthquakes' intensity on the 
Modified Modified Mercalli Scale, the level of shaking produced,and their environmental impact
- Each earthquake analysis is displayed and written to a separate text file
